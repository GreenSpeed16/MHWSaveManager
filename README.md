# MHWSaveManager
Save data backup manager for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.
## DISCLAIMER
I am not perfect and this program is early in development. Please backup your save file by copying the file named SAVEDATA1000 from the path:  
(Your Steam Folder)\userdata\(9-digit number (can be different between devices)\582010\remote  
to a safe location before using this.

To use: On startup the only enabled button will be the "Set World Folder" button. Upon clicking it a file browser will open.
Set the world folder to the following path: (Your Steam Folder)\userdata\(9-digit number (can be different between devices)\582010\remote
After doing this, you will have access to all of the program's features.

## Buttons
Set Main Save: Sets the currently loaded MHW save to your main save file. Requires confirmation so you don't accidentally overwrite your main save.  
Save Current: Allows you to save the currently loaded MHW save as a backup with a custom name.  
Load/Delete Selected: Loads or deletes the selected backup from the save list. Will ask if you'd like to re-backup your main save if switching off of it.  
Load Main Save: Loads the backup of your main save file.
